    Onboarding wholesalers and retailers to the digital marketplace was slow and inefficient. The merchandising team relied on manual processes that took hours, and getting products online could take weeks due to limited development capacity.

Designed <span class="highlight">custom integrations</span> for major retailers unable to use standard onboarding flows.</li>
    <li><strong>Results/Impact:</strong> <span class="highlight">Reduced onboarding time</span> from several weeks to 2 weeks (contract signed to products live). Standardized invoices, enabling NetSuite to automate wholesaler and retailer payments. Streamlined product data enrichment and minimized merchandising tasks.</li>

        <p>
          Phil was part of our PMO team, where he consistently demonstrated adaptability, and strategic thinking.
          Starting within the Development PMO, Phil quickly pivoted to the Business PMO without missing a beat—showing his
          ability to bridge technical and business perspectives seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phil effectively managed a diverse set of stakeholders, including external partners, internal business SMEs,
          and development teams. He excelled at facilitating discussions with all key parties to prioritize initiatives,
          ensuring that our backlog was always aligned with ROI-driven decision-making. His command of Jira, Confluence,
          Asana, and other PM tools made him a highly efficient and well-organized PM/BA/PO.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>From day one, Phil took on large-scale programs with confidence and delivered results—Logicbroker being a standout

        I’m a Business Systems Analyst who thrives at the intersection of people, process, and technology. Over the years, I’ve led large-scale system integrations, streamlined vendor onboarding, and built tools that turned weeks of manual work into days or even hours.

From producing music and writing fictional stories to developing a domain-specific AI framework project that explores how applied AI can power real-world storytelling, I enjoy pushing boundaries, blending technical rigor with creativity, and helping teams deliver smarter together.
